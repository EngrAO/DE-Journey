Retail Performance Analytics - Azure Data Engineering Project
📊 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering solution on Azure to analyze retail performance data. The solution follows the Medallion Architecture pattern using Azure Databricks to process raw retail data through bronze, silver, and gold layers, enabling comprehensive business intelligence and analytics.

🏗️ Architecture

🔄 Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
Source Data
Retail transaction data (CSV/JSON formats)

Customer master data

Product catalog information

Store location data

Sales performance metrics

Bronze Layer Processing
Raw data ingestion from multiple sources

Schema validation and basic error handling

Data partitioning by date/source

Maintenance of raw data integrity

python
# Sample Bronze Ingestion
bronze_transactions = (
    spark.read.format("csv")
    .option("header", "true")
    .load("abfss://raw@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/transactions/*.csv")
    .write.format("delta")
    .mode("append")
    .save("abfss://bronze@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/transactions")
)
⚙️ Data Transformations (Silver Layer)
Data Cleaning & Validation
Null value handling and imputation

Data type standardization

Duplicate record removal

Data quality checks and monitoring

Key Transformations
Customer data enrichment and deduplication

Product category standardization

Sales data validation and correction

Geographic data normalization

python
# Sample Silver Transformation
silver_transactions = (
    spark.read.table("bronze.transactions")
    .filter(col("amount") > 0)  # Valid transactions only
    .dropDuplicates(["transaction_id"])
    .withColumn("transaction_date", to_date(col("transaction_timestamp")))
    .write.format("delta")
    .mode("overwrite")
    .save("abfss://silver@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/transactions")
)
📈 Business Logic (Gold Layer)
Aggregated Datasets
Daily Sales Performance: Store-level and product-level aggregates

Customer Lifetime Value: Purchase frequency and monetary value

Product Performance: Top-selling products and categories

Geographic Analysis: Regional sales performance

Seasonal Trends: Monthly/quarterly performance patterns

Key Metrics Calculated
Total revenue and sales volume

Average transaction value

Customer retention rates

Product performance scores

Store efficiency metrics

python
# Sample Gold Aggregation
gold_daily_sales = (
    spark.read.table("silver.transactions")
    .groupBy("store_id", "transaction_date", "product_category")
    .agg(
        sum("amount").alias("daily_revenue"),
        count("transaction_id").alias("transaction_count"),
        avg("amount").alias("avg_transaction_value")
    )
    .write.format("delta")
    .mode("overwrite")
    .save("abfss://gold@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/daily_sales")
)
🚀 Deployment & Orchestration
Databricks Workflows
Scheduled jobs for daily data processing

Dependency management between bronze-silver-gold layers

Error handling and alerting mechanisms

Performance monitoring and optimization

Configuration Management
Environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)

Secret management using Azure Key Vault

Parameterized notebooks for flexibility

📊 Analytics & Reporting

Sample Queries
sql
-- Top performing products
SELECT product_category, SUM(daily_revenue) as total_revenue
FROM gold.daily_sales 
WHERE transaction_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Customer purchase frequency
SELECT customer_segment, 
       AVG(transaction_count) as avg_monthly_purchases,
       AVG(avg_transaction_value) as avg_spend
FROM gold.customer_metrics
GROUP BY customer_segment;
